## Overview
  This is the first project I have chosen to get started with the frontend mentor platform. Though this is easy  it is a good one to kick start the process.

## My process
Initially I created a github repository and started to add teh files I downloaded from the starter files folder of teh frontend mentor website.
After getting all the necessary files in place, I setup the structure of the page and added styles to teh component. To center the QR code container, I made the ```margin: auto``` fot the container class. Comparing the solutions in the website, it seems mine is a bit off teh mark compared to the required output. Need to optimize it a bit.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I would like to explore different ways to center a div in a page.
